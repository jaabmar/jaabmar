## Welcome to My GitHub Page!

I'm a Doctoral Student in Machine Learning and a Fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) in Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/) and [Prof. Julia Vogt](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/team/detail/julia-vogt/). My goal is to advance ML models that can be reliable and applicable in high-stakes decision-making.

I'm a Doctoral Student in Machine Learning, currently holding a fellowship at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) in Zurich. I am fortunate to have [Prof. Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/) and [Prof. Julia Vogt](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/team/detail/julia-vogt/) as my supervisors. I care about developing ML models that are both reliable and practical for decision-making in real-world, sensitive applications.
